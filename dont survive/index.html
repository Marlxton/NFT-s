                <p>He appears to be an animate plant, akin to Treeguards, though he has a green cut stone on the front of his chest. Wormwood is friendly while a little eccentric, addressing things such as insects as "Bzzters" and birds as "Tweeters."
                Wormwood has many unique abilities, and he has access to unique crafting recipes that can help with healing and defense. He is able to plant Seeds without the use of a Farm. He also seems to have some sort of kinship with plants, addressing most of them as "Friend," or things similar.</p>
